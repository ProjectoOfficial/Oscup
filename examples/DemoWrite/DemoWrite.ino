    @brief this example sketch uses oscup for writing data on UART. It initializes Oscup with a
    fixed ID and Baudrate and initializes the protocol inside void setup function.
    In the void loop it retrieves the value of the APB clock as an uint64_t, then it calls a function
    which converts this value into an array of character and after that it writes this data on UART.
    Finishing, it calls a free on the buffer.
