/* This is a demo of OSCUP protocol, in this example you have to flash this
    firmware on the ESP32.

    For running this example you must use 2 ESP32 connected one to each other.
    Let's call them ESP1 and ESP2. 

    What about Hardware connections?
    - ESP1 RX pin must be connected to ESP2 TX pin (so ESP1 pin 17 to ESP2 pin 16)
    - ESP1 TX pin must be connected to ESP2 RX pin (so ESP1 pin 16 to ESP2 pin 17)
    - Then connect ESP1 GND to ESP2 GND

    Subsequently flash the firmware (ESP32_Read on one and ESP32_Write on the other) and just open the
    serial monitor on the ESP processor on which you've flashed the ESP32_Read Firmware
